Disclaimer: The code provided here has been adapted from the original one for RCAE produced 
by Chalapathy et al. for our particular application.

RUN SETUP 
- To run the OneClass test, edit the script adi_RCAE_Class0.py and replace
   /home_USER with your home path.

- The input files parameters for outliers and validation set % (Cfg.fracVal)  must be set

- Cfg.NUMoutliers corresponds to the total number of outliers, and is equal to the combined 
   number of images for SITE 2 in the train and test sets, i.e., train/S2 + test/S2 

- Cfg.fracVal is the fraction of fingerprints assigned to the validation set. The distribution 
   of images into actual "training" and "validation" sets is carried out internally. The number 
   for Cfg.fracVal can be estimated as ~1/3 of S1 images in the combined train and test sets, 
   plus ALL images of the outliers.

   Formula for estimating Cfg.fracVal:
   Cfg.fracVal ~ {[1/3 * (# of S1 images) ] + Cfg.NUMoutliers} / [(# of S1 images) + Cfg.NUMoutliers]

   Example: if the total # of S1 images in train/S1 an test/S1 dirs is 900, and there are 10000 
   images of outliers, 

   Cfg.fracVal=  10300/ 10900 = 0.945

- To run the scripti, type 
   python adi_RCAE_Class0.py >&  adi_RCAE_Class0-Testrun

- The output file is adi_RCAE_Class0-Testrun.  
   The AUROC values are found at the bottom of the output file.
      - AUROC  correponds to the test set as defined by Chalapathy et al
      - AUROC-mytest corresponds to the cross-validation test set found in (../ADI_DB/dataL1/MyTest/).
