##### Instructions for generating the fingerprints of Abs #####
*************IMPORTANT****************************
1- This software runs on a UNIX environment
2- You need PYMOL installed in your system.
    it is free and you can get it here: https://pymol.org/2/
**************************************************
These instructions assume that you have PDB files with models of your Abs.
  Otherwise you need to generate PDB models. We use Rosetta Antibody for 
  that purpose.  Rosetta Antibody saves the models into a directory with 
  the Ab name, under subfolder "grafting". PDB files of the models 
  are labelled sequentially "model.1.pdb","model.2.pdb", ...  
  We have constructed a directory "../Models3D" that contains a couple of 
  models for two Abs using the directory structure from Rosetta Antibody


To generate the fingerprints you have to execute three commands describe below.

These are the files required:
InListAbId.txt: A file with number to reconstruct the name of Abs
                (example: ADIMAB Abs are labelled as "ADI-15975"; if you need a 
                 fingerprint for this Ab, this input file must contain the number 
                 "15975" in one of its lines)  

tmpBatch:       Template file with the instructions required for submiting a job 
                in your batch system. The last line of file must be changed to 
                with the instuction to execute you .bashrc file  

scripts: 
     FngPset.csh 
     GenerCG.pl 
     FngRun.pl  
     FngScrps.bsh 

** COMMAND #1 **
   csh FngPset.csh InListAbId.txt ADI-
     1st argument is a file listing the Abs
     2nd argument is the generic label of the set of Abs

     The previous command generates a subdirectory "RosMod" with subdirectories 
      for all the Abs from the list (InListAbId.txt) that were found. The script  
      fills the subdirectories with symbolic links to all the Ab models.a It also, 
      generates a file named "ListADIs" that will be used as input in the next step. 

** COMMAND #2 **
perl -w  GenerCG.pl ListADIs

This command prepares the directories where the fingerprints will reside.


** COMMAND #3 **
perl -w  FngRun.pl CG-ADI-Abs ListADIs OUTA

Submit jobs for fingerprint generation to the batch queue
FngRun.pl uses the output of GenerCG.pl (ListADIs) to select the Abs

Examples of the OUTPUT files are included in the directory "./OutputExamples"

To check the number of fingerprint images (PNG files) produced, use the cmd: 
ls -1 ./CG-ADI-Abs*/*/*png | wc -l
