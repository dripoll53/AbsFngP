# AbsFngP
This repository contains files associated with a project on antibody (Ab) classification.
We provide code for generating a 2-D representation (or fingerprint) of an Ab binding site, 
and a series of python scripts to produce and train Deep Neural Network (DNN) models for
Ab classification. We also provide examples of input and output files.

For additional information related to fingerprint generation, please check the 
"Fingerprints: folder and follow the instructions in the README.FngP file.

For additional information on the Deep Neural Network Applications, Python scripts and 
examples of Deep Neural Network training, please check the DNN folder.
